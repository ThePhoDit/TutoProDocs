# Modules

Every module and section has to be written in the same way as shown in the documentation, as it is case sensitive.

#### How do I configure the bot then?

Well, you can obviously edit what you are supposed to, I mean that you cannot edit the keys, but there is no problem with the values.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember that all fields are case sensitive.
{% endhint %}
