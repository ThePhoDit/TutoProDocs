# Locale

The locale is the language TutoPro will reply to you. Translations are made by the community, so not every language will be available. You can check which ones you can use in the [Available Locales](locale.md#available-locales) section below.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you select a language that is not on the list, English will be selected by default.
