# Aliases

Aliases is a premium feature that allows you to setup aliases for commands.

The structure of its configuration is `aliasName: 'command'`. You will understand it with the example below:

```yaml
aliases:
  w: 'warn'
  pong: 'ping'
```

The command `w` would execute the command `warn`. 

The command `pong` would execute the command `ping`.
