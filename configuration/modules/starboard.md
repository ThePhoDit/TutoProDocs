# Starboard

This module allows you to star those funny messages so that they don't get lost. This is how the configuration looks like:

```yaml
starboard:
  channel: 'Channel ID'
  stars_amount: 3
```

**Channel:** ID of the starboard channel.

**Stars Amount:** Amount of stars that a message needs to get to the starboard.
