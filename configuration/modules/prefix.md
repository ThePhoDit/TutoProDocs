# Prefix

The prefix is what makes the bot know that you are trying to run a command, so it is essential. You can set anyone.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The prefix must be quoted.
{% endhint %}

```yaml
prefix: ';'
```

The one you can see above is the default one for TutoPro, but as I said before, you can customize it as you want. Here you can see another example:

```yaml
prefix: '!!'
```
