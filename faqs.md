# FAQs

### How do I copy an ID?

You can find a complete guide about copying IDs [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).

### What shall I do if TutoPro goes down?

Let any staff in the support server know and it will be online as soon as possible. Keep in mind that in most situations, the bot recovers itself.

### Why is the bot not responding?

Check TutoPro's permissions. The ones asked when inviting the bot are required for everything to work.

### Why the mute command is not working?

Make sure that the role that TutoPro created is above the muted role.

### How can I setup a gatekeeper for my server?

If you have the premium version of the bot, check the [security module](configuration/modules/security.md). Remove the `everyone` role permissions to see your server channels and create a new one that can see them.

In the configuration, add a password and select your new role in the roles section. Leave a channel in your server where new users can use the [password command](commands/miscellaneous.md#access-secured-server-roles).

### Can I translate TutoPro into my language?

Sure, just join the [support server](https://support.phodit.xyz) and ask for it in the support channel.
