# User Agreement

Welcome, and thanks for choosing TutoPro as a moderation bot for your Discord server. When using it, you are agreeing to the terms listed below.

## Bot Usage

* Every server the bot is in has to be manages by at least one user.
* If you find someone abusing of the bot, you do not hesitate to add them to the bot's [local blacklist](../configuration/modules/blacklist.md).
* If we find that any server administrator is not properly utilizing TutoPro, the bot can be removed from it, previously receiving a formal warning.

## Data Storage

We only store the essential data for the bot to work. This data is:

* Members information, saved in cache and not stored longer than one week.
* Content from the messages triggering any [moderation command](../commands/moderation.md). This content is used to ensure the proper functioning of TutoPro.
* Content from the messages triggering any [reminder](../commands/reminders.md) or [tag](../commands/tags.md) command. This content is sent by the bot and by saving it we ensure that it is not used for any inappropriate action.
* [Suggestions](../commands/suggestions.md) content.
* All [logs](../configuration/modules/logs.md) content, which is not really saved but is sent to the selected Discord channel, so it can be viewed by the server's administrators and moderators at any time.
* Suggestions content in order to interact with it.

This data is saved locally, so it never goes outside the storing machine. It is not accessible by anyone but Discord or any other legal entity with an order stating they can access it.
