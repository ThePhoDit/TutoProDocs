# Commands Levels

To make configurations simpler, every command has a default level. You will find the level of a command next to its description in the following pages between parenthesis.

While choosing which ones to use, we've associated four level to the most common server ranks. These are:

| Level | Associated Rank |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100 | Administrator |
| 60 | Moderator |
| 40 | Helper |
| 0 | Everyone |

These levels will be used in the [commands module](../configuration/modules/commands.md) if no permission is stablished.
